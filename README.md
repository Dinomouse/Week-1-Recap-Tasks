# Bank Holiday Tasks

The bank holiday is a good opportunity to relax, recharge, and spend time with the people and hobbies in your life outside of code - believe it or not, there is life outside of code!

However, we've covered a lot of JavaScript this week. We'll be continually using and building on what we covered throughout the course, so it's important to spend time this weekend continuing to practice and embed what you've learned so you're ready to hit the ground running next week.

Please complete the tasks below before we reconvene at 9AM on Tuesday. Aim to spend at least an hour each day coding.

## Solidify your JavaScript foundations

üëâ If you didn't finish the hackathon, make a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of the repository. This creates a copy of your pair repository that's just yours so you can continue to make changes on your own without affecting your partner.

üëâ If there are any workshops from this past week, that you haven't finished, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) those repositories and finish working through them.

üëâ If you feel like you need more practice, FreeCodeCamp's [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) activities are a great way to to review and reinforce. You don't have to go in order - you can target which of the FCC activities you choose to do around the concepts we've covered:

- Variables
- Strings
- Numbers
- Booleans
- Arrays
- Objects
- If statements
- For loops
- While loops
- Functions

üëâ Make a list in this readme file (use the list above as a starter!) of what you feel comfortable with and what you still need to work on more so you can track your progress and target your practice.

## Codewars

Codewars is a great place to practice breaking down problems into solvable chunks and problem solving in pairs. It has challenges called katas with scenarios and puzzles that you'll solve by writing a function in JavaScript, and we'll use these throughout the course for [deliberate practice](https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice) in problem solving and articulating.

Katas are ranked in difficulty, and the numbers work in reverse - level 8 (8 kyu) katas are the easiest, while level 1 (1 kyu) are the most difficult. For each kata you complete you get honor points toward levelling up your own rank, and you can also see your position on a leaderboard for some healthy competition - we'll have more about that soon!

üëâ Sign up to [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/join) using your Github account. You'll need to select JavaScript and solve your first kata before you can finish signing up.

üëâ Use the videos in [this playlist](https://vimeopro.com/schoolofcode/codewars) even if you've done Codewars before to get the flavor of how we use Codewars during the course. These explain the School of Code way of tackling Codewars katas that gets you in the habit of breaking down the problems, writing a plan, and articulating to practice for interviews.

The password for the video page is the word bootcamp.

üëâ Work through this set of first katas that practice the JavaScript fundamentals we've gone through:

- [Multiply](https://www.codewars.com/kata/50654ddff44f800200000004/train/javascript)
- [Even Or Odd](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53da3dbb4a5168369a0000fe/train/javascript)
- [Sum of Positive](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5715eaedb436cf5606000381/train/javascript)
- [Opposite Number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56dec885c54a926dcd001095/train/javascript)

üëâ Then work through these katas as next steps:

- [Sentence Smash](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53dc23c68a0c93699800041d/train/javascript)
- [If you can't sleep, just count sheep!!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b077ebdaf15be5c7f000077/train/javascript)
- [Grasshopper - Summation](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55d24f55d7dd296eb9000030/train/javascript)

### Bonus: Keep practicing!

‚≠ê Explore Codewars and keep practicing. Most of the challenges are community generated, so not all of them are perfect. We'd advise that you sort by popularity and pick ones that are `8 kyu` to start with. When you've had enough of 8s, try your hand at some popular 7s. Happy coding!
